# Punch Intern

Punch is a time-servicing app for high school internship programs. This was recently made public as we have been giving it away to schools for free.

Now, students are graduating with transcripts that reflect their work-based learning hours. This way, they can be pipelined into trade work and not waste time in trade school/apprenticeships.
